# AutoType

This is a simple script which takes in a text file argument and reads the file line-by-line, typing it into the current in focus window on your machine (very useful for texting a friend the entire script of The Bee Movie for example).  

1. Make sure you have a valid Python 3 install with pip package manager!
2. Install the dependencies of the script with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the script with `python3 autotype.py <filepath>`
4. There will be a 3 second delay for you to navigate to the window and text field you want to type in before it begins. If you want to change this time, simply edit the `time_delay` variable at the top of autotype.py
5. Watch the script work!
