Based on characters appearing in Archie Comics Publications

WARNER BROS. TELEVISION
ACT ONE
ICONIC SHOTS of an American SMALL TOWN. Beginning with: A “Welcome
to Riverdale” sign. Its faded motto: “The Town with Pep!”
A Male Teenager’s VOICE-OVER narrates:
UNSEEN MALE TEEN (V.O.)
There is an idea of Riverdale...
WE SEE: Nondescript SUBURBAN STREETS, anonymous, mysterious.
UNSEEN MALE TEEN (V.O.)
...of what kind of town it is, what sort
of families live there...
WE SEE: Riverdale’s MAIN DRAG. Store-fronts, local businesses.
People, different ages, sizes, races, walking...
UNSEEN MALE TEEN (V.O.)
...a notion that it exists unchanged and
unchanging, as if frozen in a time-capsule...
WE CYCLE THROUGH IMAGES OF: City Hall, Pickins Park, the Bijou
Movie Theatre, the Fire Station, the 24-hour Diner, POP’S...
UNSEEN MALE TEEN (V.O.)
...that it must be exactly how it presents
itself to the outside world. Safe. Decent.
Innocent. So that if you were looking at it
from the window of a train, rushing by, you
might wish you lived there...
WE SEE: A DERELICT BUILDING, with boarded-up windows, brick walls
covered in graffiti; a couple of skinny, possibly methed-out KIDS
stumbling into the building’s dark DOORWAY...
UNSEEN MALE TEEN (V.O.)
...but that’s only one aspect of it, and
only on the surface...
IMAGES OF: The High School, the Police Station, the Comic Book
Shop, the Train Station, the Liquor Store...
UNSEEN MALE TEEN (V.O.)
...the truth is, if you really want to
understand Riverdale, and what kind of
place it is, I have to tell you about its
shadows, the town beneath the town...
EXT. SWEETWATER RIVER - EARLY MORNING
A beautiful, slow-moving RIVER, eternal, hypnotic. 
UNSEEN MALE TEEN (V.O.)
...starting, I guess, with what the
Blossom twins did this summer...
A RED CONVERTIBLE crests the hill overlooking the river, stops,
tires crunching on gravel. Taken by Tree’s cover of “Sweet Child
o’ Mine” plays on the car’s stereo, as two impossibly gorgeous
TEENAGERS, both red-haired, step out of the car...
They are JASON and CHERYL BLOSSOM, and really, they could be
models from an Abercrombie & Fitch catalogue.
CAR STEREO
“She’s got a smile that it seems to me/
Reminds me of childhood memories...”
They look out at the river’s shimmering, rippling surface, start
walking towards a DOCK...
UNSEEN MALE TEEN (V.O.)
On the fourth of July, just after dawn,
Jason and Cheryl Blossom drove out to
Sweetwater River for an early morning
boat-ride, as was their custom...
As they near the dock, Cheryl hesitates.
JASON
Are you scared, Cher-Cher?
Cheryl shakes her head; Jason smiles, takes her hand, leads her
onto the wooden dock, to a ROWBOAT at its end. The song keeps
playing, wafting down from the convertible’s open doors...
EXT. SWEETWATER RIVER - MOMENTS LATER
Jason and Cheryl in the rowboat, sliding across the water, towards
an outcropping of rocks. They pass into -- and out of -- frame...
EXT. SWEETWATER RIVER - THE SHORE - THE SAME MORNING (LATER)
Nerdy, glasses-wearing high school geek DILTON DOILEY guides a
troop of BOY SCOUTS along the river's edge. They all carry
BINOCULARS. Dilton’s pointing to BIRDS in the trees...
UNSEEN MALE TEEN (V.O.)
The next thing we know happened for sure
is that Dilton Doiley, who was leading
Riverdale’s Boy Scout Troop on a birdwatching expedition, came upon --
-- Dilton and the Scouts stop short. There’s Cheryl, huddled by
the lapping water, knees tucked under her chin, arms around her
legs, shivering because she’s sopping wet.
2.
DILTON
...Cheryl? Are you okay?
Numb, in shock, she turns to him. Her face is streaked with tears.
CHERYL
...Ja...Jason...
Then, one of the SCOUTS, pointing out at the river, yells --
BOY SCOUT
-- look! Out on the water!
The ROWBOAT’s upside-down, banging lazily against those rocks, in
the middle of the river...
EXT. SWEETWATER RIVER - DAY (LATER)
A POLICE BOAT anchored by the rocks. DETECTIVE SAM HILL, drinking
from a mug, is in charge. SCUBA DIVERS jump into the water.
UNSEEN MALE (V.O.)
Riverdale Police, led by Detective Sam
Hill, dragged the river for Jason’s body,
but hours later, still nothing...
The ENTIRE TOWN is watching from the riverbank. Parents holding
their kids. Blonde ALICE COOPER stands with her husband HAL and
their daughter POLLY (18), pretty but tweaked-out and damaged.
HAL
(staring out)
They’ll never find him. Not with that
undercurrent.
ALICE
Awful to say, but I hope he suffered. In
those last moments.
POLLY
(simmering rage)
Jason Blossom burns in hell.
UNSEEN MALE TEEN (V.O.)
Needless to say, there were no
fireworks in Riverdale that night...
EXT. RIVERDALE’S CEMETERY - DAY
The BLOSSOM FAMILY -- dad CLIFFORD, mom PENELOPE, and CHERYL (all
with red-hair, all in black) -- standing at a freshly dug grave,
as a MINISTER says a few words (we don’t hear)...
3.
UNSEEN MALE TEEN (V.O.)
A week later, the Blossom family buried
an empty casket, and Jason’s death was
ruled an accident, as the story Cheryl
told made the rounds. That an early
morning idyll turned tragic when Cheryl
saw a ribbon in the water, and Jason
reached down to get it, and accidentally
tipped the boat, and panicked, and
drowned...
INT. POP’S CHOCK’LIT SHOPPE DINER - NIGHT
Open 24-hours. A skinny teenager with dark, shaggy hair sticking
out from under a weird hat -- it’s like a felt CROWN -- sits in
one of the diner’s booths, tap-tap-tapping away on his laptop.
This is JUGHEAD JONES. An emo-heartthrob.
JUGHEAD JONES (V.O.)
...which is super-weird, because Jason
was captain of every sports team at
Riverdale High, including water polo, and
during summer vacations, he worked as a
lifeguard at the country club...
A WAITRESS stops by with a coffee pot, gestures with it, does
Jughead want a refill? He nods, holds up his cup.
JUGHEAD JONES (V.O.)
Not that anyone examined those facts too
closely, or asked too many questions...
Probably because the Blossoms were
like...poison roses in the garden of
Riverdale -- and no one wanted to get
pricked on those venomous thorns...
EXT. THE PEMBROOKE APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSK
A TOWNCAR pulls into the Gothic APARTMENT BUILDING's driveway.
JUGHEAD JONES (V.O.)
So the “July 4th tragedy” became just
another suburban legend -- a cautionary
tale we would analyze and regurgitate
endlessly -- until some new scandal or
mystery rolled into town...
Two dark-haired beauties -- HERMIONE LODGE (pearls, always) and
her teenage daughter VERONICA, on her iPhone -- climb out of the
car, look up at the Pembrooke’s ornate facade...
VERONICA
(trying to rally)
The gargoyles remind me of the Dakota.
4.
HERMIONE
The same architect did this one, the
Pembrooke. The apartment’s small, a piedà-terre, but --
HERMIONE/VERONICA
-- “quality, always” --
HERMIONE -- and, it was the only piece of property
in my name, not your father’s, so the
courts couldn’t take it from us.
Hermione grips Veronica’s hand.
HERMIONE (CONT’D)
You’ll make a go of it here, won’t you?
The people in Riverdale, they’re kind and
forgiving in a way they just aren’t in
New York.
VERONICA
...I’ll try, Mom. I promise.
The building’s FRONT DOOR opens. The Pembrooke’s doorman,
SMITHERS, in a uniform, comes out, waves, approaches --
SMITHERS
Ms. Hermione! Welcome home, Ma’am. How
was the ride?
HERMIONE
No traffic, thank God.
(then)
Smithers, you’ve never met my daughter
Veronica, have you?
SMITHERS
Never. It’s a pleasure, Miss.
VERONICA
Hi...
SMITHERS
I’ll get your bags.
(as he does that)
And would you like some menus, Ma’am, so
you can order in?
HERMIONE
Oh, no, I’ve had a craving for one of Pop
Tate’s cheeseburgers since the Tappan Zee
Bridge -- his diner’s still open, I pray?
VERONICA
(the horror, the horror)
-- diner?
5.
EXT. ELM STREET - RIVERDALE - NIGHT (THAT SAME NIGHT)
We hear crickets, a dog barking, end-of-summer sounds. The Camera
pans across a series of MODEST HOMES along a tree-lined street.
Towards ONE HOUSE in particular...a BEDROOM on the second floor...
INT. THE COOPER HOUSE - BETTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Blonde, pretty BETTY COOPER (16), in jeans and a bra, getting
dressed, while brown-haired KEVIN KELLER (16, cute) lounges on
her bed, scrolling through profiles on his iPhone.
BETTY
I thought you already had your “date”
picked out for tonight --
KEVIN
-- I did, jockbud92, but then he
suggested we meet in the bathroom of a
truck stop off Route 80 --
BETTY
Uhm, hi, Craigslist killer --
KEVIN
-- so it’s back to the grind on Grindr.
Or -- can I just hang out here with the
twinks of FraternityX.com until you get
back? My parents are warpathing --
BETTY
Oh, no, why this time?
KEVIN
Same old, same old. General Keller goes
on a bender, calls me a homo, Mom starts
yelling, I’m out the front door --
(speaking of same old...)
-- are you excited? Nervous?
BETTY
Both -- I haven’t seen him all summer --
KEVIN
-- which is why nerves are acceptable,
but we agreed: It’s time. Your parents
want to micromanage every aspect of your
life? Fine, but not who you date -- there
are limits, Betty. Post-LA, you’re in
your P.O.P. -- your Place of Power. You
like him, he likes you, it’s what needs
to happen. Cosmically.
BETTY
Then why hasn’t he ever said or done
anything?
6.
KEVIN
Because -- Archie’s swell, but like most
Millennial straight guys, he needs to be
told what he wants. So tell him, finally.
BETTY
We’ll see. It depends on --
KEVIN
-- oh, my God!
BETTY
What?
Kevin is looking out Betty’s window, towards THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR,
into the BEDROOM opposite hers. ARCHIE ANDREWS (16, red hair,
finally on the right side of puberty), is also getting dressed.
In jeans, slipping on and buttoning up a shirt --
KEVIN
Rojo-hel-lo! Archie got hot! He -- he has
abs now! I count six, maybe eight --
Betty looks; her heart sinks --
BETTY
-- oh, no.
KEVIN
No, no, this is good, abs are a
game-changer --
BETTY
-- yeah, but now...everyone’s gonna see
what I’ve been seeing my entire life.
KEVIN
All the more reason for you to take that
ginger bull by the horns tonight.
Archie's walking out of his room, sending a text, turning off the
light. Betty gets the text -- “meet out front?” -- picks a shirt,
starts to put it on; Kevin doesn’t approve --
KEVIN (CONT’D)
God, no, the other one --
EXT. ELM STREET - RIVERDALE - NIGHT
Betty comes out of her house. Wearing the shirt Kevin wanted.
Archie, hands shoved in his pockets, looks at her.
ARCHIE
Wow.
BETTY
Hi, Archie.
ARCHIE
You look -- tan. And awesome.
BETTY
(smiles, shy but pleased)
Thanks. You, too. You look -- different.
Not just buff, but, like --
7.
-- suddenly, Archie’s hugging Betty. Super-tight.
ARCHIE
-- I missed you this summer, Betty. So,
so much...
This hug’s a tad intense. Like Archie doesn’t want to let go...
BETTY
...me, too. I...missed you, too...
INT. POP'S CHOCK-LIT SHOPPE DINER - NIGHT
Archie and Betty sit in a booth, in mid-conversation --
ARCHIE
-- what was the highlight?
BETTY
Of my internship? The Judy Blume book
release party I organized, by far --
INT. BARNES & NOBLE - THE GROVE (IN LA) - DAY (FLASHBACK)
Slow-motion: JUDY BLUME at a table, signing books for a massive
CROWD. Betty stands behind Judy, with a clip board, beaming...
BETTY (V.O.)
-- at the end of the night, she said to me,
“Enjoy this time, Betty, and remember...”
INT. POP’S CHOCK’LIT SHOPPE DINER - NIGHT (THE PRESENT)
RESUME WITH: Betty and Archie...
BETTY
“...when you’re fifteen, one summer can
change your life.”
ARCHIE
That’s. Freakin’. Epic.
BETTY
It was everything. And I may not have gone
to LA if you hadn’t encouraged me, Archie,
so -- thanks. You always believe in me...
(that hangs there, then:)
How was working for your dad?
ARCHIE
It was...pouring concrete, literally every
day, all day long. So to pass the time --
(beat)
 -- okay, do you remember in 5th-grade?
8.
(MORE)
My Mom and Dad gave me that guitar for my
birthday and I made us all play Rock
Band?
(Betty nods, does she ever)
-- anyway, to pass the time at work, I
started composing these...poems, in my
head. Then, at night, I’d get home, and
I’d write them down. And -- try to fix
them. Revise them.
BETTY
The Robert Frost of Rockland County...
ARCHIE
It took me half the summer to realize they
weren’t poems, they were song lyrics. And
the other half to realize...uhm...
BETTY
What, Archie?
ARCHIE
(almost ashamed to admit it)
...I don’t want to pour concrete for the
rest of my life, Betty. Or whatever my
dad’s, like, grooming me to do. Manage
the guys who pour the concrete. I wanna
be... (I can’t even say it, it sounds so
stupid...)
BETTY
You wanna be the guy...who writes songs... about the guys who pour the concrete?
Archie’s looking away -- at Jughead, in his booth, at the other
end of the diner. A quick wave -- Jughead waves back -- then,
Archie turns back to Betty for some truth-telling --
ARCHIE
You’re lucky you were away this summer,
Betty, it was -- messed-up. It messed me
up. The stuff with the Blossoms, it was --
hardcore.
BETTY
That’s what my mom and dad said.
(then)
What was it like?
ARCHIE
...surreal. For three days, everyone in
town met by the river, waiting for Jason
to...surface. And every day he didn’t,
less and less people would show up.
(darkly)
I’m never going back to Sweetwater River.
That place is cursed.
9.
ARCHIE (CONT'D)
BETTY
My parents wanted to write a story about
it, for “The Register” -- they tried to --
but the Blossoms killed it. Threatened to
sue, to shut the paper down for good.
ARCHIE
Darkest. Summer. Ever. The only good
thing was -- writing songs? Made me feel
like I’d finally broken through to
something...real. About my life and what
I should be trying to do with it.
Starting this year -- tomorrow.
BETTY
What about football?
ARCHIE
I’ll try-out, at least.
BETTY
Have you told your dad?
ARCHIE
That I’m deviating from his grand plan? For
music? No. Until I’ve got it more figured
out, you’re the only person I’m telling.
BETTY
(that sinks in)
...can I hear them? Your songs?
ARCHIE
Definitely. I’m finishing some demos
tonight.
BETTY
Great. Oh -- and also?
(here she goes:) ...I’ve been thinking about us, Archie, and
our friendship, and how it’s time we --
-- suddenly, the BELL above Pop’s front door jingles. And in comes
Veronica, wearing a fetching cloak (like Kim Basinger in “L.A.
Confidential”). She approaches the diner’s owner, POP TATE, behind
the counter.
VERONICA
Hi, I called in an order? For Lodge?
POP TATE
(heavy Greek accent)
Two burgers, yah, almost ready, but you
must to wait.
10.
Veronica looks around while she waits -- there’s some weird dude
typing away (Jughead), nope -- but then her eyes land on Archie,
who’s staring at her, which Betty clocks. It’s like when Claire
Daines and Leonardo DiCaprio see each other through the fish-tank
in “Romeo and Juliet.” Veronica walks over to them...
VERONICA
Hi. How are the onion rings here?
BETTY
Uhmmm...
ARCHIE
Addictive, they’re so good.
VERONICA (CONT’D)
(over her shoulder, to Pop)
Can we get some onion rings, too, please?
(back to Archie and Betty)
Thanks. My mom and I just moved here, so...
ARCHIE
From where?
VERONICA
New York. Do you guys go to Riverdale?
BETTY
We do. Both of us. Together.
ARCHIE
(can’t take his eyes off her)
We’re sophomores.
VERONICA
Me, too. I’m filled with dread.
ARCHIE
How come?
VERONICA
...are you familiar with Truman Capote’s
oeuvre? I’m “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” but
this town is strictly “In Cold Blood.” No
offense.
(they have no idea what she’s
saying; then, a hand -- )
-- Veronica Lodge.
ARCHIE
(taking it)
Archie Andrews. This is Betty Cooper.
VERONICA
Wait, are you -- ?
BETTY
-- supposed to give you a tour tomorrow?
Yes, I’m your peer mentor.
11.
VERONICA
(not fun)
Fun.
ARCHIE
Do you want to join us? And maybe we can
un-fill you with dread?
Betty shoots daggers at Archie. Veronica smiles, demurs.
VERONICA
My mom’s waiting for me. But...maybe I’ll
see you tomorrow?
PRE-LAP: The sound of SOMEONE CRYING...
INT. CHERYL BLOSSOM'S BEDROOM - MORNING (THE NEXT MORNING)
Cheryl, in her cheerleading outfit (Blue and Gold), sits at her
vanity, sobbing uncontrollably, studying herself in the mirror.
A KNOCK on her door; it’s her mother PENELOPE --
PENELOPE’S VOICE (O.S.)
-- Cherry? You alright?
Like a switch has been flipped, Cheryl stops crying, wipes the
tears from her face. She's become a totally different person.
CHERYL
Fine, Mommy, I'm just practicing in case
I have to cry today.
(to herself, in mirror)
“I loved my twin brother. In many ways,
he was my soul-mate.”
(then, debating:)
Maybe no crying’s better.
INT. THE COOPER HOUSE - BETTY'S ROOM - MORNING
Betty, getting ready to head-out. A KNOCK on her door; it opens.
It's Betty’s mom, ALICE, coming in --
ALICE
-- we’re sending next week’s issue to the
printers tonight, so Dad and I’ll be home
late.
BETTY
You know, Mom, one day? Eventually? “The
Register” will be all digital, and you’ll
be able to work from home.
ALICE
That would break your father’s heart.
(sitting down, heart-to-heart)
12.
(MORE)
Betty. This coming year -- sophomore year?
It’s critical for colleges. Grades are
important, extra-curriculars are important
-- athletics, important -- maintaining a
decent character? Hugely important,
colleges do look at that.
BETTY
You say that every year.
ALICE
You’ve accomplished so much, Betty, I don’t
want anything jeopardizing that. Think
about your poor sister. Polly was such a
shining star till she let herself be ruined
by that Blossom boy -- and now, where is
she? She’s turned her room into a cave --
she never comes out --
BETTY
-- I’m not Polly, Mom.
ALICE
No, but it’s so easy to slip, Betty. You
missed curfew last night.
BETTY
By seven minutes. And I was with Archie.
Who has red hair, yes, but he is nothing
like Jason Blossom.
ALICE
Oh, sweetie. They’re all like Jason.
(she strokes her daughter’s hair)
I love you so much, Betty...
(taking Betty's hands in hers)
I just need you to be as smart as I know
you are. And stay. Focused.
With that, Alice stands, goes. We linger on Betty. Alice has left
something in her hands. Reveal: A PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE of ADDERALL
with Betty’s name on it. The message is clear: Betty. Must. Stay.
Focused.
INT. THE COOPER HOUSE - HALLWAY - MORNING
Betty comes out of her room. As she heads towards the stairs, she
glances at a DOOR at the end of the hall (Polly’s room). Painted
BLACK, messily, angrily, like a Rothko. It’s creepy; Betty might
as well be looking at the possessed girl’s bedroom door in “The
Exorcist.” Betty shudders, continues on her way...
13.
ALICE (CONT'D)
INT. THE ANDREWS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
Archie's parents, FRED and MARY ANDREWS, on their feet, checking
their phones, having a quick breakfast before heading out --
MARY
-- I’m showing the house on Lakeshore.
FRED
To that same couple again? Tell them you
know an excellent contractor --
Archie comes in, trying to make a fast getaway --
ARCHIE
Hey, Mom -- Hey, Dad --
(grabbing a pancake to go)
First day and I’m already late --
FRED
-- hey, hey, wait, hang on -- you coming
by after school?
ARCHIE
Dad --
FRED
Not to work on the crew, you did your
time already -- this is to get you
started in the office -- so that next
summer --
ARCHIE
(dodging)
-- I can’t, I’ve got football try-outs.
FRED
Oh, are you doing that? You haven’t been
talking much about football, so I --
ARCHIE
(bristling)
-- I played last year -- I’m gonna tryout, at least -- or is that not okay?
FRED
(beat)
Of course it’s okay. Go. Good luck.
Archie goes. Mary and Fred share a moment:
MARY
Remember what it was like when we had a
son? And he talked to us?
FRED
You mean three months ago? Good times.
14.
EXT. RIVERDALE HIGH - MORNING
Establishing. TEACHERS going in; KIDS loitering out front, trying
to extend the summer even for a few more minutes...
BETTY (PRE-LAP)
When Principal Weatherbee asks me to give
a tour, I usually start with a little
history and context. Riverdale High first
opened its doors in 1941 --
INT. RIVERDALE HIGH - HALLWAYS - MORNING
Betty’s leading Veronica down a locker-lined hall --
VERONICA
-- and hasn’t been redecorated since,
apparently. Honestly, I feel like I’m
wandering through the lost epilogue of
“Our Town” -- what’s the social scene
like here? Any night clubs?
BOY’S VOICE
(behind them)
A strip club called the Hoe Zone and a
tragic gay bar called Innuendo --
Betty and Veronica turn to -- KEVIN, coming up behind them...
KEVIN
Friday nights it’s football games, then
tailgate parties in the Walmart parking
lot -- attendance is mandatory. Saturday
night is movie night, regardless of
what’s playing at the Bijou -- and better
get there early, because we don’t have
reserved seats in Riverdale. Sunday
nights, thank God for HBO.
BETTY
Veronica Lodge, Kevin Keller. Veronica’s
new here, Kevin is --
VERONICA
-- gay, thank God. Let’s be best friends.
KEVIN
Is it true what they say about your dad?
VERONICA
That he’s the devil?
KEVIN
That he’s in jail, about to be on trial?
15.
VERONICA
...I stand by my father. Does everyone
here know?
(they’re silent; to Betty)
Do you know?
BETTY
(nods)
But, unlike some, I wasn’t going to bring
it up unless you did.
KEVIN
Oh, shit, sorry --
VERONICA
(to Betty)
I appreciate your discretion.
They continue on their way -- and with the tour...
INT. RIVERDALE HIGH - HALLWAY - MORNING
Archie, at his locker, holding a FOLDER, which contains a SHEAF OF
HAND-WRITTEN PAGES -- he’s making notes on them -- and which he
shoves into his bookbag, when he sees his two bro-friends, REGGIE
MANTLE and MOOSE MASON, approaching --
REGGIE
-- Bro, you are READY for football -- you
got hella swole, you’re a beast. Your
arms are diesel. How’d that happen? You
on T? Anadur? Anavar? AndroGel? Oxy-DecaDurabolinol? Because I told you. My
cousins down in Miami --
ARCHIE
-- it’s from working construction, Reg.
REGGIE
Oh, yeah, that’s right -- hey, hey, did
you do any houses? Any private homes?
ARCHIE
A couple.
REGGIE
Sweet. And were you supervised by the lala-la-ladies of the houses?
ARCHIE
...where are you going with this, Reggie?
REGGIE
Where I’m going is where I hope you went:
Did you tap any MILF ass this summer?
16.
EXT. RIVERDALE HIGHWAY - SUNDOWN (FLASHBACK)
Archie, walking home from a job, pulls up his shirt, to wipe his
forehead, when a cute VW BUG slows down...stops right in front
of him. The driver’s side WINDOW rolls down, revealing -- A SEXY
22-YEAR-OLD WOMAN, in sunglasses, sipping a Cherry Slurpee...
REGGIE (V.O.)
‘Cause you know that’s what
they want, right?
22-YEAR-OLD WOMAN
Archie? Thought that was you.
What are you doing, walking in
this heat?
REGGIE (V.O.)
These bored, lonely, sex-starved
housewives?
ARCHIE
Uhm. Building character?
REGGIE (V.O.)
A young, hot football-stud to
service them?
22-YEAR-OLD WOMAN
(smiling at him)
Wanna ride?
OFF ARCHIE, debating this offer, as we RESUME WITH --
INT. RIVERDALE HIGH - HALLWAY - MORNING
-- Archie, Reggie, and Moose. As Archie backs away from them...
ARCHIE
...I think that’s more an Xtube fantasy
from your spank-bank, Reggie --
-- and Archie’s down the hall, around a corner, and WE HEAR:
JOSIE (PRE-LAP)
Excuse me, this is a closed rehearsal.
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
Archie, holding his pages from the locker, has just come into the
room, where three girls -- JOSIE AND THE PUSSYCATS -- were in the
middle of a practice jam. VALERIE (dark-haired) and MELODY (a
platinum blonde) stand with their instruments, behind their
leader: Gorgeous, imperious JOSIE, at a microphone. All three
ladies wear the ICONIC PUSSYCAT EARS. (Yep, Gang, we’re all in.)
ARCHIE
Uh, sorry, I, I didn’t know --
(except, yeah, he did) -- but, now that I am here, I was hoping to
talk to you about -- some songs? I wrote?
JOSIE
(eyes narrowing)
Do I even know you?
17.
VALERIE
His name’s Archie Andrews. He was in our
Pre-Cal class last year.
(she smiles, making intro’s)
-- I’m Valerie Brown, by the way. This is
Melody Jones.
Valerie’s obviously crushing on Archie...
ARCHIE
-- Archie, hey -- hi.
(back to Josie)
So, my songs. I was hoping you would maybe
consider recording one or two for your --
JOSIE
Let me stop you right there -- Archie,
was it? You’re staring at our pussycat
ears, which is rude, but let me break it -- and them -- down for you. The
Pussycats are building a brand, we’re
telling a story. Last year, we won
Rockland County’s Battle-of-the-Bands --
ARCHIE
-- I know, I was there, you were --
JOSIE -- yes, we were. This year, we’d like to
build on that success. Continue telling
our story. With songs we write.
ARCHIE
I hear that, I just --
(cards on table)
You’re doing what I want to be doing. If
I can get a song -- even one song of mine
-- out there, for people to --
JOSIE
-- uh, you can. YouTube.
ARCHIE
If I record one of my songs and post it
on YouTube, it’s like, “Who cares?” --
(Josie gestures, “Agreed”) -- but, if the Pussycats sing and post
one of my songs on their YouTube channel,
with their two-hundred-thousand-plus
subscribers, that would actually mean
something.
JOSIE
I won’t argue the point, but look at us.
We’re a girl-group -- of color --
18.
ARCHIE
-- lots of divas -- of color -- perform
songs written by -- Caucasian dudes --
Beyoncé, Christina, Nikki -- maybe if you
tried one, even to hear how it sounds --
JOSIE
Read my glossed lips, Justin Gingerlake:
Not. Gonna. Happen.
INT. RIVERDALE HIGH - HALLWAY - MORNING
We see: Archie, slinking out of the classroom where the Pussycats
are. WE PAN from him, down the hall, to -- Veronica, still with
Betty and Kevin, looking at Archie go...
VERONICA
There’s the hottie you were with last
night. The red-headed Ansel Elgort.
KEVIN
The hotness is a new thing. Last year, Archie
was like Liam Hemsworth. This year? He’s more
Chris Hemsworth. Not that Liam isn’t edible, I
totally would, but --
VERONICA
Is he your boyfriend?
KEVIN
No, he’s straight.
BETTY
No, we’re just friends.
VERONICA (CONT’D)
In that case, mind putting in a word? I’m
in dire need of a boy-toy to distract me
till the spring collections are released,
and I’ve tried every flavor but orange --
KEVIN -- actually, to clarify: Betty and Archie
aren’t dating, but we’re hoping they soon
will be. They’re endgame, but as with all
epic romances, there are issues. Selfesteem. Confidence. We’re working on
them.
They pass a POSTER on the wall, for the Back-to-School dance.
VERONICA
Will you ask him to the dance?
KEVIN
She should, but I heard it might be
getting canceled. Because of Jason.
They’re gonna tell us at Assembly...
19.
SINGING VOICES (PRE-LAP)
“All hail, our fair Riverdale...”
INT. RIVERDALE HIGH - GYMNASIUM - MORNING
THE ASSEMBLY. STUDENTS sit on bleachers; TEACHERS, in folding
chairs. Weatherbee's at a podium. A young teacher, GERALDINE
GRUNDY (in glasses), leads the school’s CHOIR as they finish up:
CHOIR
“...here friendships started/Near or
parted/Al-ways stay with yo-OU!”
They finish. No APPLAUSE, except for Mr. Weatherbee --
WEATHERBEE
-- thank you for that, Ms. Grundy, always
nice to hear from our choir.
(he begins)
On behalf of the teachers and staff of
Riverdale High, I want to welcome you all to
what I’m certain will be a memorable school
year. Those of you who are returning may
notice some changes -- but before getting
into that, we felt it would be remiss not to
acknowledge the member of our community...of
our family...we lost this summer. Jason
Blossom.
(STUDENTS react, variously)
His sister, Cheryl, has asked to say a
few words. Cheryl?
Cheryl, who's been sitting in the front row, makes her way to the
podium. Weatherbee sits with the other teachers.
CHERYL
Thank you, Principal Weatherbee. I’d like
to begin with a moment of silence.
People comply, bowing their heads. Veronica’s like, Really?
MEANWHILE, under the bleachers: Jughead, lurking, his laptop under
his arm, apart from everyone else, but watching everything...
CHERYL (CONT’D)
Many of you were lucky enough to have
known my brother personally. Maybe you
were in a class with him, or you played
on a team with him, or you were Facebook
friends with him, or followed him on
Twitter, or Instagram, or Snapchat...
Sitting with Reggie and Moose, Archie stiffens. Tries to make eyecontact with Ms. Grundy, who’s looking at the floor.
20.
CHERYL (CONT’D)
It doesn’t matter. The point is: Each and
every one of you, whether you knew it or
not, meant the world to Jason...
Kevin “glances” a HOT NEW STUDENT, who “glances” him back.
CHERYL (CONT’D)
I loved my twin brother -- in many ways,
he was and always will be my soul-mate --
which is why I can say with confidence
that Jason wouldn’t want you -- us -- to
spend the year mourning. He would want
you -- us -- to move on with our lives.
Veronica tries to “glance” Archie, but it’s a no-go.
CHERYL (CONT’D)
To the end, I've asked Principal Weatherbee that we not cancel the Back-to-School
dance. But rather, that we use it as a
way for us to heal, collectively, and to
celebrate my brother's too, too short
life, thank you all.
Archie finally locks eyes with Ms. Grundy. Now that we’re focused
on her, even though she’s wearing glasses, we see -- it’s the
same woman who offered him a ride in the VW bug -- a revelation
that PUSHES US into --
EXT. FAIRGROUNDS - DUSK (FLASHBACK)
START ON: A CROWD of teenagers, gathered around an OUTDOOR STAGE,
where Josie and the Pussycats are performing. Above them, a SIGN
over the stage reads: BATTLE-OF-THE-BANDS. The Pussycats’ song is
slow, sultry...
THE CAMERA pans from the stage, over the Crowd...to a BARN...
On the other side of the barn, WE FIND: Ms. Grundy’s bug, parked,
out of sight. Archie’s leaning against it as Ms. Grundy, grooving
to the song, sexily dances over to Archie -- think Nicole Kidman
in “To Die For” -- and kisses him... THE KISS takes us back to --
INT. RIVERDALE HIGH - GYMNASIUM - DAY (THE PRESENT)
The Present. Around Archie, the student body is still applauding
Cheryl, but he is laser-focused on Ms. Grundy, and vice-versa...
END OF ACT ONE
21.
ACT TWO
INT. RIVERDALE HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY
Post-Assembly. Archie’s trying to catch-up to Ms. Grundy, who
walks ahead of him, through the students going to class --
ARCHIE
Ms. Grundy --
(she keeps moving)
Hey, Ms. Grundy, wait up --
-- Ms. Grundy turns on her heel to face Archie.
MS. GRUNDY
What can I do for you, Mr. Andrews?
ARCHIE
I -- I -- can we talk, Ms. Grundy?
MS. GRUNDY
That depends. About what?
A FLASH -- of Archie and Ms. Grundy making out, hot, forbidden -- a memory Archie pushes out of his mind as quickly as he can --
ARCHIE ...music, you’re the music teacher, can
we talk about music?
MS. GRUNDY
...of course. Make an appointment. During
my regularly scheduled office hours.
She turns, starts to walk away from him again.
FRED (PRE-LAP)
Hermione Lodge.
INT. ANDREWS CONSTRUCTION COMPANY - LOBBY - DAY
Veronica’s mom, Hermione, sits in the waiting area. Archie’s dad,
Fred, has come out of his office.
HERMIONE
(smiles)
How are you, Fred?
FRED
Shocked to hear from you. Come on back.
22.
INT. ANDREWS CONSTRUCTION - FRED’S OFFICE - DAY
Not much fancier than the lobby, though Fred at least has pictures
of his family on his desk. Hermione sits, as Fred asks --
FRED
Do you want a water?
HERMIONE
(right into it)
-- I want a job, Fred. I saw on your
website, you’re looking for a seasonal
hire, someone to help with the books?
FRED
I am. My guy’s on paternity leave, but --
HERMIONE
-- I think my daughter’s going to school
with your son, isn’t that funny? We’ll
have to tell them we knew each other,
that we even dated, for awhile, until --
FRED
-- you chose the rich kid. Richer than I
was, at least.
HERMIONE
And now, a reversal of fortune.
(then)
...I have a little money saved, not much,
enough to get us through Christmas. I’m
praying that someone in Riverdale --
maybe an old friend -- is willing to give
me the benefit of the doubt.
FRED ...are we old friends? We haven’t seen
each other since...graduation? Riverdale
High, Class of --
HERMIONE
-- now you’re just being mean.
FRED
Hermione. If it were up to me --
HERMIONE
Isn’t it? It’s your company --
FRED
-- yes, but I have clients, and I’m
looking to expand, and this is -- well,
it’s not much, but it’s my legacy. What
I’m building for Archie. I can’t very
well have Hermione Lodge, wife to Hiram
Lodge, on trial for fraud and
embezzlement, balancing my books.
23.
HERMIONE
(a beat; it stings)
...no, I don’t suppose you can.
(then, tightly)
What on Earth was I thinking? Oh, yes,
that Riverdale would somehow be more
accepting and less cruel than the savages
of the Upper East Side. My mistake.
INT. RIVERDALE HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY
LUNCH-TIME. Kids at picnic tables. Veronica’s moving across the
courtyard, searching for the perfect place to land...
There are the Pussycats, nope... The football players, including
Reggie and Moose, not a good idea... There’s Betty... Dilton, with
the nerds, uh-uh... Cheryl, with her fellow cheerleaders,
including ladies-in-waiting, NANCY WOODS and GINGER LOPEZ, clearly
the Queen Bees... Veronica sighs, like attracts like, she heads
towards Cheryl, but then -- a double-take -- she notices that
Betty isn’t sitting alone, she’s with that hottie, Archie;
immediately, Veronica detours...
...arrives at the table where Betty and Archie are, sitting with
Archie’s open laptop.
VERONICA
Can I join you?
They nod -- she sits -- Betty and Archie are listening to
something on Archie’s computer. SOMEONE SINGING.
VERONICA (CONT’D)
What are we listening to?
It’s a TEENAGER’S VOICE. Untrained, but cool. Angsty.
ARCHIE
Uhm. I recorded these songs...
VERONICA
That’s you singing? A song you wrote?
They listen. The song’s great. A little dark, a little sexy. Then,
Archie closes his laptop; the play-back stops --
ARCHIE
-- I did. It’s rough.
BETTY
It’s great --
VERONICA
It’s incredible, actually, the
little I heard --
24.
VERONICA
(genuinely impressed)
 -- is that your thing? Music? Are you
doing something with that?
ARCHIE
Well, I already struck out with the
Pussycats --
VERONICA
The who?
BETTY
Josie and the Pussycats. They’re this semifamous band that goes to school here --
Betty gestures to where the Pussycats are sitting. Wearing, as
always, their cat ears.
VERONICA
Hmm. A bit early for Comic-Con, isn’t it?
BETTY
Archie’s trying to set-up an independent
study --
(turning to Archie)
-- with Ms. Grundy, right?
ARCHIE
That’s the plan, we’ll see.
(changing the subject)
How’s your first day been?
VERONICA
We-ell, not to be a complete narcissist,
but I thought people would be more...
BETTY
Obsessed with you? Are you disappointed?
VERONICA
Relieved, actually.
BETTY
Any other year, you’d be trending at
Number One, for sure. This year, though,
it’s all about Cheryl Blossom...
They look across the way, at Cheryl, who is walking towards them.
Which, for some reason, prompts Archie to --
ARCHIE
-- I, I should go. I, uh. Have that meeting
with Grundy, then football try-outs.
VERONICA
You play football, too? #Renaissanceteen.
25.
Veronica looks at Betty, who’s looking at Archie, as he goes...
VERONICA (CONT’D)
...wow, and suddenly I’m in YA Novel/Fanfiction Hell. I’m assuming Bella hasn’t
asked Edward Cullen to the dance yet?
BETTY
Not yet --
(lowering her voice)
-- and please, let’s not talk about
Archie in front of --
CHERYL
(arriving, grandly)
-- Veronica Lodge, I’d heard rumors, may
I sit? Betty, would you mind?
Betty slides over so Cheryl can sit right next to Veronica.
CHERYL (CONT’D)
My daddy did business with your daddy. He
says your daddy’s being railroaded, and that
I should take you under my wing -- what are
you two gossiping about? Archie’s Efron-esque
emergence from the chrysalis of puberty?
Betty looks at Veronica, pleadingly.
VERONICA
-- extracurriculars. Weatherbee wants me
to sign up for a few.
CHERYL -- cheerleading. You must. I’m senior
captain of the River Vixens!
VERONICA
...cheerleading -- like in that old movie
“Bring It On”?
CHERYL
Some people say it’s retro, I say it’s
eternal and iconic --
VERONICA
-- I’m kidding. At Spence, I sat at the
top of the Elites’ pyramid, I’m so in.
(then, not a question:)
Betty, you’re trying out, too.
CHERYL
(abso-fucking-lutely not)
..of course, anyone’s welcome to try-out,
but Betty’s already got so much on her
plate, and being a Vixen is kind of a
full-time thing. But whatevs.
26.
(MORE)
(she stands; to Veronica:)
Follow me on Twitter and I’ll do the same
-- cherrybombshell’s my handle.
And as quickly as she appeared, Cheryl vanishes, off to terrorize
God-knows-who next. Veronica turns back to Betty:
VERONICA
Go ahead and hate on cheerleading, but if
Hipster Prince Harry is playing football --
BETTY
-- I’d love to be a cheerleader, is the truth --
(off Veronica’s surprise)
-- it would round-out my college applications --
but I tried out last year, and Cheryl said I
was too fat. She said I was -- “Season Five
Betty Draper.”
VERONICA
Were you? You’re a total smoke show now.
(makes a decision)
If you want to be a River Vixen, we’ll
try out, together --
(Betty’s uncertain)
...come on, what’s the worst that could
happen?
INT. RIVERDALE HIGH - MUSIC CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON
Grundy, earbuds in ears, listening to something on Archie’s
iPhone. Reading along from the sheaf of SCRIBBLED PAGES. It
finishes; Ms. Grundy takes out the buds. Archie, on a chair,
opposite her, waits for the verdict...
MS. GRUNDY
They're very real, very -- personal.
ARCHIE
Thanks, Ms. Grundy, I, I took your
advice. But I was maybe hoping you could
help me a little more...
MS. GRUNDY
(a beat, then:)
With what, Archie? You’ve got something
to say, you’re saying it. That puts you
ahead of -- most everyone in Riverdale.
ARCHIE
Uhm. Thanks. But the thing is...
(beat)
...I can transcribe lyrics, I can play
some chords on my guitar -- you know that
-- and I can record myself singing, but --
that’s it.
27.
CHERYL (CONT'D)
(MORE)
I have no clue how to write the music --
the actual notes -- down. And you only
heard a couple, but all my songs sound
basically the same.
MS. GRUNDY
You need to learn Composition, Variation.
ARCHIE
Everything. Including, maybe, some
different instruments. Billie Joe
Armstrong? From Green Day? Plays the
guitar, the drums, the piano, the
mandolin, the saxophone, the harmonica --
MS. GRUNDY
Archie --
ARCHIE
-- you went to Juilliard, Ms.
Grundy. Last year, you did a
private tutorial with Tomoko
Yoshida and now -- now, she’s at
Carnegie Mellon.
MS. GRUNDY
Tomoko was a senior, and she’d been
studying violin all her life --
ARCHIE
-- which is why I need your help even
more. Look, there’s no one else I can
take lessons from -- believe me, I’ve
looked -- even if there were, I couldn’t
afford them -- it’s you or nobody.
MS. GRUNDY
I don’t...think that would be a good
idea, Archie. I don’t think...we should
be alone -- I mean, do you?
(Archie churns, silent)
If this is about you wanting us to restart something that never should’ve
started in the first (place) --
ARCHIE
-- it’s not, it is about music, but it’s
also... Please, Ms. Grundy -- I need to
be able to talk about what happened with
someone.
MS. GRUNDY
(carefully)
We have -- we did -- all summer long.
ARCHIE
Yeah, but what we heard --
MS. GRUNDY
(definitively)
-- we heard fireworks, Archie,
it was the Fourth of July --
28.
ARCHIE (CONT'D)
ARCHIE
-- who’s lighting fireworks at six in the
morning?
(then)
We heard...what we heard, and then Cheryl
screaming, and we -- didn’t do anything --
and afterwards, we didn’t say anything --
MS. GRUNDY
How would we have explained that we were
at Sweetwater River at six in the morning
on July Fourth?
(Archie has no answer)
And you’re right, we didn’t say anything,
so now we have to live with that choice --
both of us -- do you understand?
(Archie’s not making eye-contact)
Archie, look at me --
(he does) -- do you understand?
(Archie nods)
And you should pursue your music -- you
have talent -- but not with me.
EXT. STREETS OF RIVERDALE - AFTERNOON
Betty and Veronica, walking to Betty’s, along a street that has
VACANT LOTS along one side, ROW HOUSES along the other...
VERONICA
...we’ll set the routine today, then
review it tomorrow morning before tryouts, if you want -- that sound okay?
BETTY
Yeah, except -- you know I’ll never make
the squad, right? Not in this lifetime.
Veronica looks at Betty; something’s not adding up here...
VERONICA
(a beat, then:)
...Betty, don’t take this the wrong way,
but can I make an observation? Hot as you
are, and smart as you are, you should be
ruling the school. But instead, you’re
scared of trying out for cheerleading? And
of asking a ginge out? What’s that about?
Come on, dish the dee, spill the tea.
(Betty’s silent)
I’ve been in therapy since I was six.
I’ve heard it all.
Betty looks out, across the field of grass, waving in the wind...
A beat. She starts to say something, then, suddenly, turns --
29.
BETTY
-- train.
They hear a TRAIN WHISTLE. One is coming up, behind them, along
the TRAIN TRACKS running through the field. Betty, with purpose,
strides towards the tracks --
VERONICA
What? Betty? What are you -- ?
BETTY
(still moving)
It’s okay, It’s just a freight
train --
VERONICA
(scared)
What the hell does that mean?
Veronica starts after Betty. It looks like Betty’s going to step
onto the tracks, in front of the oncoming train --
VERONICA (CONT’D)
(panic rising)
Betty -- Oh, my God, BETTY --
-- Betty stops, scant inches from the tracks. Lifts up her arms,
so that they (and she) are parallel to the tracks, as the TRAIN
whooshes past her, so close Betty could reach out and touch it --
-- Betty screams at the top of her lungs; the sound blends in with
the train’s SHRIEK. It’s terrifying...a rush...and then...it’s
over...the train’s speeding away... And Veronica’s left gaping at
Betty, who turns back to her, breathless...
BETTY
(deep breaths)
Helps. With. The. Stress.
(then)
Get me on the cheerleading squad, and
I’ll tell you everything.
EXT. RIVERDALE HIGH - FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY (THE NEXT DAY)
The guys are all suited-up, running drills, smashing into each
other. Over this, we hear CHEERING:
VERONICA/BETTY (V.O.)
“Riverdale is where it’s at/We bring the
game/’Cause we’re all that/We play to win--
Archie flattens Reggie -- takes off his helmet -- offers Reggie a
hand up. From the sidelines, Riverdale’s two coaches, KLEATS and
CLAYTON, confer...
VERONICA/BETTY (V.O.)
“--we won’t back down/’Cause we’re the
hottest game in town!”
30.
EXT. RIVERDALE HIGH - GYMNASIUM - DAY
On the GYM STAGE, Veronica and Betty, doing sharp cheer-ography,
as -- Cheryl, Nancy, and Ginger (behind a table), observe.
VERONICA/BETTY
“We're Blue & Gold/We're Dynamite/The
‘Dogs’ll bark/And then they'll Bite/We'll
take you down/And fight the fight!”
B & V end on a high-note, but Cheryl’s stone-faced.
CHERYL
I was hoping for something a bit...racier.
Okay. So this is how Cheryl’s gonna play it.
VERONICA
Well, you haven’t seen our big finish yet.
(whispering to Betty)
Don’t freak out -- Trust me --
Then Veronica plants a big, wet KISS on Betty’s lips -- and the
heads of every Archie fan on the planet explode! It’s the watercooler moment of the 2016/17 television season! Or...is it? The
girls turn back to Cheryl, who stifles a yawn.
CHERYL
Check your sell-by date, ladies. Faux lesbian
kissing hasn’t been taboo since Britney and
Madonna did it -- in 2003. So, before you reenact Janet Jackson’s “shocking” nip-slip of
2004, let’s move on to the interview portion
of our audition, m’kay? To make sure you’re
of sound mind as well as body. How often do
you talk to your father?
VERONICA
-- me? Oh, uh, once a week -- on
weekends.
CHERYL
And would you say you’re on good terms?
VERONICA
-- all things considered, yes.
CHERYL
Moving on: Betty, how’s your sister doing?
BETTY
Polly’s -- fine, thanks for asking.
CHERYL
Veronica, has Betty told you about her
sister yet? And my brother?
31.
VERONICA
Uh, no --
CHERYL
Is it because you’re ashamed, Betty?
BETTY
No, I wasn’t sure if I could trust her.
Veronica looks at Betty. Harsh, but she gets it.
CHERYL
Ah, but we River Vixens must be able to
trust each other with our deepest,
darkest secrets. So go ahead, Betty, tell
Veronica about your sister and my
brother.
BETTY
Polly and Jason -- dated.
CHERYL
I wouldn’t say “dated.”
BETTY
They -- whatever’ed. Freshman year, when I
was in seventh-grade. It didn’t end well.
CHERYL
In fact, Jason’s probably why your sister
had a nervous breakdown, isn’t it?
BETTY
That’s -- what my parents think.
Cheryl looks at Nancy, at Ginger, then back to our girls.
CHERYL
Well, is there anything you want to say
about that, Betty? Go ahead, the floor is
yours. I’m giving you a free pass. To say
whatever’s on your mind. Whatever you’ve
been dying to spew about Jason and how he
treated Polly, unleash it. Destroy me.
Without fear of reprisal. I just want to
hear you say it... I know you’ve thought
about it. Stayed awake all night long,
imagining how you’d rip me a new asshole...
Well, the moment is here. It’s now. And I
swear to you, on my brother’s grave, it
won’t have any bearing on my decision to --
BETTY
(giving in)
-- I just.
CHERYL
(satisfaction) -- finally. Yes?
32.
BETTY
...I...I just want to say...I’m sorry
about what happened to Jason. I...I
can’t even imagine what you and your
family must be going through.
Needless to say, that’s not what Cheryl was hoping for. Sigh.
CHERYL ...right. Veronica, welcome to the River
Vixens. Come to a kiki I’m hosting after
the dance. Betty, better luck next time.
VERONICA
-- what? Wait, why? Because you couldn’t
bully Betty into being a bitch?
CHERYL
I need girls with fire on my squad.
Betty starts to leave the stage, Veronica grabs her arm --
VERONICA
(chillingly matter-of-fact)
Oh, I know what you need, Cheryl, because
I know who you are. You’re Riverdale’s Red
Queen -- or, should I say, “Red Widow,”
since you lost your “soulmate”?
(then)
Either way, you’d rather people fear than
like you. You traffic in terror and
intimidation. You’re rich, so you’ve never
been held accountable, but I’m living
proof: That certainty -- that entitlement -- you wear on your head like a crown? It
won’t last. You might have another year,
another two years, another ten years, but
eventually, there will be a reckoning...
(beat)
Or maybe...that reckoning is now. And
maybe, that reckoning...is me. If you know
who I am, then you also know: I have
nothing to lose. And that I, too,
understand a little something about fear
and intimidation. To that end...
(beat)
Betty and I come as a matching set. You
want one, you take us both. If that doesn’t
work for you, she and I will start a
Booster Club, open to guys and girls, which
people would join, and which would eclipse
your River Vixens by...lacrosse season, I’m
thinking... You wanted fire? Sorry,
Cherrybombshell, my specialty’s ice.
And with that, a gauntlet's been thrown. OFF CHERYL, mulling...
END OF ACT TWO
33.
ACT THREE
INT. RIVERDALE HIGH - BOYS' LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON
After try-outs, Archie’s on a metal table; ASSISTANT COACH CLAYTON
is icing Archie's sore leg. HEAD COACH KLEATS enters --
COACH KLEATS
That’ll bruise, but you’ll be alright.
(then)
Last two days, you’ve been playing with
some real -- stuff out there, Andrews.
Like you’re trying to get something out.
Something you didn’t have last year.
(then)
Usually, sophomores only play JV, but
this year, we’ve got an open spot on
Varsity. Based on what you’ve been
showing us, I’d like you to have it.
ARCHIE
Me? Not Reggie? Or Moose?
COACH KLEATS
We carry Mantle because his father
subsidizes our department. And Moose, God
bless, isn’t bright enough for Varsity.
ARCHIE
-- I, I need to think about it, Coach.
COACH KLEATS
What’s more important than football?
ARCHIE
(vamping)
My...my dad’s company. It’s our family
business and he’s sort of counting on me
to help out, after school, on weekends...
(a beat -- then, realizing:)
...wait, is the spot Jason’s Blossom’s?
COACH KLEATS
It is. You’d get his locker, his number.
‘Course, you wouldn’t be captain...
This lands on Archie. He’d be the dead boy’s replacement. Whoa.
INT. RIVERDALE HIGH - GIRLS’ LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON
Post-try-outs, post-shower, Betty and Veronica, in towels, backs
to each other. As Veronica combs out her wet hair, Betty looks
over her shoulder, tentatively -- asks, quietly:
34.
BETTY
...why did you defend me?
(off Veronica’s look)
I know the circles you ran with in New
York, and -- they’re not me. So why are
you doing this, why are being -- nice?
A beat -- as Veronica turns to Betty, gets real...
VERONICA
...when my dad got arrested? It was the
worst thing ever. All these...trolls
started writing these horrible things
about us. We’d get letters and e-mails,
saying my dad was a thief, my mom was a
clueless socialite, that I was this
spoiled rich-bitch ice-princess,
and...what hurt most about it was...
(is she going there?)
The things the trolls were writing...were
true. I was like Cheryl -- worse than
Cheryl -- not a person I particularly
enjoyed spending time with, to be
honest...
(eyes wet, getting emotional)
So, after everything that happened with
my dad, when my mom said we were moving
to Riverdale, I made a pact with myself:
To use this as a chance to become --
maybe, hopefully -- a better version of
myself...
This unexpected admission prompts Betty to lower her own guard...
BETTY
...when Polly got together with Jason, it
meant everything to her and nothing to
him, and, and things got super-intense and
toxic -- I don’t know the details, no one
will tell me -- but what came after... How
Mom treated Polly after what happened with
Jason was so much worse... She turned on
Polly. Said Polly wasn’t her daughter,
said all these horrible things to her...
(then)
Jason hurt Polly, but it’s my mom who
broke her...
(then)
-- now, I guess, I’m under some pressure
from my parents not to turn out the way
Polly did...
VERONICA
Some pressure? You’re like Katniss
Everdeen before a reaping.
35.
CHERYL (O.C.)
Oh, good, the Sweet Valley High twins are
still here.
They turn to Cheryl, flanked by Nancy and Ginger --
CHERYL (CONT’D)
I have something...for both of you.
EXT. RIVERDALE HIGH - ENTRANCE - DAY
-- Betty and Veronica, wearing the iconic blue-and-gold Riverdale
High cheerleading outfits, BURST OUT the doors, in a rush, on a
high -- which doesn’t dissipate when they see -- Archie, heading
from the gym, towards his car. Veronica turns back to Betty --
VERONICA
-- okay, you’re doing this.
BETTY
What?
VERONICA
(grabbing her arm)
Slaying your dragons, Betty Cooper, one
by one.
Veronica drags Betty over to Archie.
VERONICA (CONT’D)
Hi, Teen Outlander.
ARCHIE
-- hi. Hey, Betty. Nice
(outfits) --
VERONICA (CONT’D)
-- Betty has something she wants to ask
you. About the Back-to-School dance. Go
on, Betty, ask.
BETTY
...I was wondering if you maybe wanted to
come with us -- both of us.
ARCHIE
Huh?
VERONICA
What?
BETTY (CONT’D)
-- I asked Veronica to go with me to the
dance, as friends, but maybe it would be
fun if all three of us went together? As
friends?
ARCHIE
I, uh...the thing is, I’m not really in
the mood for (a dance) --
36.
BETTY
Oh, that’s (okay) --
VERONICA
(jumping in)
-- totally unacceptable, we need an
escort. So take a break from being
Riverdale High’s resident tortured
musical genius and spend a blissful
evening with not one, but two newlyminted River Vixens --
(giving him no choice)
Resistance is futile, Tiger, we’ll text you
T & P, Time and Place.
ARCHIE
(helpless) ...oh-kay, then. ...cool. ...thanks,
Betty. Thanks, Veronica.
Archie continues on his way. Veronica turns to Betty, WTF?
BETTY
It’s your first dance at Riverdale, you
should have someone to go with.
VERONICA ...fine, but just as your handmaiden. As
soon as we get there, I’ll peel off so you
can be alone with Archie to ask him how he
feels about you -- and then you’ll know,
and you’ll be much happier -- deal?
Betty nods -- a beat -- could this girl actually be a friend?
EXT. THE PEMBROOKE APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSK
Hermione arrives home, spent. Smithers is there, opening the door.
SMITHERS
Was today any better, Ms. Hermione?
HERMIONE
No, Smithers, worse. I was even slapped
today; that was fun. Every single place I
go to apply for a job, the moment they
hear who I am, who my husband is... It
was naive of me to think this would’ve
played-out any other way. (No, not naive,
stupid -- blind...)
SMITHERS
(a beat, then:)
I'm due a fifteen-minute break, Ma'am.
37.
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND THE PEMBROOKE - MOMENTS LATER
Hermione and Smithers, around the side of the building, next to
some DUMPSTERS. Smoking tightly rolled JOINTS.
HERMIONE
As always, you are a godsend, Smithers.
(takes a puff, exhales)
So many people in Riverdale hate us...
SMITHERS
Your husband made a number of enemies in
this town, Ma’am. And Riverdale, itself,
is not as forgiving as it once was.
HERMIONE
No, but -- you don't hate us.
SMITHERS
No, Ma’am. Your husband always took care
of me and my family. He helped me buy my
own apartment in the Pembrooke. In the
back, not much of a view, but it’s ours.
So whatever you need...
HERMIONE
I appreciate that, Smithers, but I'm
afraid I've made a terrible error in
judgment, coming back to Riverdale.
EXT. THE ANDREWS HOUSE - THE BACK PORCH - LATE AFTERNOON
Archie, with his guitar, experimenting with a new song. He plays
some, then makes notes in a notebook by his side. Fred comes out,
drinking a beer. Not angry, but something’s weighing on him.
FRED
I got a call from your Coach today. He’s
under the impression that you can’t play
Varsity Football because I’m making you
work for me...
(Archie’s busted!)
Which is odd, since you intimated that
you couldn’t work for me because you were
playing football... So my first question
would be: Who are you lying to? Me or
your Coach?
ARCHIE
Neither -- Both -- Shit -- (deep end of the swimming pool:)
I, I want to study music, Dad -- write
music.
38.
FRED
(processing)
And that means you can’t play football?
Or work with me?
ARCHIE
It means -- I have to figure it out. If
I’m gonna get serious about music. Which
I want -- which I’m going -- to do.
FRED
When did you decide this?
ARCHIE
It’s sort of been an ongoing process --
FRED
-- because it used to be, we talked about
things like this. Big decisions, life
decisions.
(then, imploring:)
Your best shot at going to college is
getting a football scholarship to a state
school.
ARCHIE
Not the places I’d go for music.
FRED
Archie... Right now, you wanna study
music -- that’s great, I’m all for it --
when I was in high school, I was in a
band -- but what happens in six months,
when you move on to something else?
ARCHIE
I’m not going to, Dad.
(famous last words:)
And I’m not talking about a band.
FRED
Football takes you to college, college
takes you to business school, business
school (takes) --
ARCHIE
-- takes me back to work for you, here in
Riverdale.
FRED
With me, not for me. And eventually for
yourself, the company would be yours.
ARCHIE
No disrespect, Dad, but I don’t want it.
39.
FRED
Three months ago, you did -- at least you
said you did. What changed?
ARCHIE
Me. Everything. This summer --
But Archie stops himself from saying too much.
FRED
What? Talk to me.
ARCHIE
This summer, I...
Archie can’t. What would he say to his dad?
FRED
What, Archie? Tell me. If something’s
wrong, I can help --
ARCHIE
You can’t, Dad -- You actually can’t, not
this time...
A beat. Fred nods, resigned.
FRED
...that’s it, then. We don’t talk to each
other anymore. We keep secrets -- okay.
ARCHIE
Dad --
FRED
I would never force you to play football --
I don’t care if you play football. And
you don’t have to work with me or for me,
ever again. But some advice, man-to-man?
The choices you’re making now -- they’re
the most important of your life, Son. So --
good luck to you. Let me know what you
decide.
Fred turns from Archie, and goes back into the house; nothing
resolved between father and son...
INT. THE COOPER HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL - LATE AFTERNOON
Betty, in her cheerleading uniform, comes home. The sound of LOUD
ARGUING from the living room. Betty rounds the corner -- Alice and
Betty’s older sister, POLLY, are going at it -- until they see
what Betty’s wearing -- a beat -- then, both at once:
40.
ALICE
-- what. Is. That?
POLLY
-- are you on crack?! You’re
joining the River Vixens?
ALICE
No, she is not -- That’s how it started
with your sister-- I don’t need another
Polly, Betty, one trainwreck’s enough --
POLLY -- I’m the trainwreck? Mom, open your
medicine cabinet -- the only person in
Riverdale more medicated than me is you --
ALICE
(to Betty)
Take that off --
POLLY
(to Betty)
If you’re trying to prove something --
BETTY
-- I’m not, Polly -- Believe it or not, not
everything is about you -- either of you --
(terrified, but enough)
-- I do everything for everyone -- everything
to be perfect -- the Perfect Daughter, the
Perfect Student, the Perfect Sister -- can’t
I do this one thing for me? And no, not one
thing -- I’m also going to the dance with
Archie -- and, and Veronica Lodge --
ALICE
Hermione Lodge’s daughter?
POLLY
Good luck with that --
BETTY (CONT’D)
She’s actually really nice and trying to
be a good person --
ALICE
Oh, you think so? You think she’s your
friend? You think Cheryl will be? Well,
let me tell you, girls like Cheryl and
Veronica Lodge, they don’t like (girls
like you) --
BETTY
-- I don’t want to hear it, it’s
happening, I’m going --
-- Betty’s up the stairs, into her room, and -- SLAM!!
END OF ACT THREE
41.
ACT FOUR
INT. RIVERDALE HIGH - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
Decorated for the Back-to-School Dance. Streamers, lights, and...
GIANT PHOTO-PORTRAITS OF JASON BLOSSOM, hovering over everything.
Archie, Betty, and Veronica arrive, arm-in-arm, and the moment is
like Cinderella arriving at the ball, Carrie arriving at the prom
(before the bucket of blood). Veronica takes it in, sighs...
VERONICA
Well, it’s not the Met Ball.
BETTY
Oh, my God, you’ve been?
VERONICA
Twice. Anna Wintour’s daughter follows me
on Instagram.
ARCHIE
Who’s Anna Wintour?
VERONICA
(excusing herself)
On that note, I’m getting some punch.
(sotto, to Betty)
Don’t let me down, Girl.
Veronica goes. Archie and Betty move further into the crowd...
BETTY
Anna Wintour is editor-in-chief of Vogue. There’s no reason you would (know that) --
Archie spots Ms. Grundy, off to the side, chaperoning --
ARCHIE
-- shit, Betty, will you give me one
minute?
(off her “you’re kidding” look)
And I promise, when I get back, I’ll be a
much better date --
(as he goes)
Two minutes, max --
Archie’s off, making his way towards Ms. Grundy. Before Betty can
get too upset, she’s rescued by -- Kevin, arriving with the Hot
Guy who glanced him during the Assembly.
KEVIN
Betty -- have you met Devin Davis? His
family just moved here from England.
DEVIN
Hello.
42.
But WE’RE WITH: Archie, approaching --
ARCHIE
-- don’t panic, Ms. Grundy, I’m not
single-white-stalking you.
MS. GRUNDY
I thought --
(lowering her voice) -- didn’t we have a deal?
ARCHIE
-- no, we have a secret, Geraldine.
Multiple secrets, actually. And maybe we
could’ve done something to help Jason
that morning, or maybe we couldn’t have --
MS. GRUNDY
-- we will never know.
ARCHIE
Yeah, and like you said, we have to live
with that. Our secrets. And I won’t tell
anyone, anything -- but, you need to help
me. I’m not the Pussycats, I’m not Tomoko
Yoshida, I’m not my Dad, but I could be --
I will be -- someone. (then)
Maybe it’s a colossal mistake, but this
summer, the only thing that kept me sane
was writing those songs. So -- here’s my
not-so-indecent proposal. I want to do an
Independent Study with you, as many
mornings a week as you can spare, and I
swear: That’s all it will be. And I won’t
tell anyone about July Fourth, ever -- deal?
Fuck, is Archie blackmailing Ms. Grundy? Is that the kind of show
we’re doing?
MS. GRUNDY
...Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, 7:30
AM, before First Period, I, I’ll set it
up. And see about getting you credit.
At which point, a HUSH falls across the gym. Archie and Ms. Grundy
turn towards it; Veronica, at the PUNCH TABLE, turns to it; Betty,
Devin, and Kevin turn to it; the whole world, it seems, turns to --
-- CHERYL BLOSSOM, flanked by her ladies-in-waiting, Nancy and
Ginger, making a GRAND entrance. Unlike the other kids, Cheryl’s
wearing an OUTRAGEOUSLY over-the-top CRIMSON GOWN. Gasp-inducing.
43.
INT. POP'S CHOCK-LIT SHOPPE DINER - NIGHT
Hermione with Betty's mom, Alice, in a booth. Each having a
MILKSHAKE. Hermione’s is strawberry; Alice’s, vanilla.
HERMIONE
Apparently, I have found the one thing in
Riverdale that hasn’t changed.
(toasting)
To Pop Tate and his glorious milkshakes.
ALICE
To Pop Tate.
They slurp, then:
ALICE (CONT’D)
When I heard, through the grapevine, you
were back in town, I thought, “I should
reach out.” Then, when Betty told me she
and Veronica were going to the dance, I
thought, “Heck, why not tonight?”
HERMIONE
Even though we didn’t always get along in
high school?
ALICE
Didn’t we? Well, maybe we’ve evolved
beyond our high school selves...
ANGLE ON: Jughead, coming out of the bathroom, washing his hands,
taking note of Alice and Hermione as he heads back to his booth...
ALICE (CONT’D)
Hermione, we didn’t invest with Hiram --
we were small potatoes -- but even if we
had, I’m not one of those biblical types
who believes the Wife should be punished
for the Sins of the Husband, especially
if the Wife didn’t know the Husband was
sinning -- did you?
HERMIONE
(a beat, then:)
I've done many things in my life I'm not
proud of, Alice. But I'd never knowingly
steal from my family and friends.
ALICE
“Knowingly.” That’s the word, isn’t it?
The one that makes all the difference.
The gulf between guilt and innocence...
Alice studies Hermione, who’s giving. Up. Nothing.
44.
ALICE (CONT’D)
...I went away, too, Hermione. For
college. Hal and I both did. And then
we came back. To raise our daughters
here -- build a life here. Not just
because of “The Register,” but because
we believe in Riverdale. We believe --
I believe -- it’s the kind of town that
forgives. That gives second chances.
HERMIONE
I’m not quite feeling that yet...
ALICE
Let me prove it to you. Let me try to
help you find a job. We get listings at
“The Register” before anyone else. What
you and your daughter are doing -- moving
here on your own, starting over -- I have
nothing but admiration for that.
HERMIONE
I...
(helpless to say anything but:)
Thank you, Alice.
CHERYL (PRE-LAP)
First, I’d like to thank everyone for the
support they’ve shown me since school
started...
INT. RIVERDALE HIGH - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
RESUMING WITH -- THE DANCE. Cheryl has taken control of the stage
and stands at a MICROPHONE. Behind her, Josie and the Pussycats
are tuning up their instruments.
CHERYL
...I wouldn’t have made it through
without your unconditional love and
healing energy.
ANGLE ON: Veronica, looking from Cheryl, to -- Reggie, huddled
with Moose and some of the other FOOTBALL PLAYERS, passing around
a FLASK...
CHERYL (CONT’D)
Secondly, I’d like to thank Principal
Weatherbee for agreeing to donate the
proceeds from tonight’s dance to a
scholarship fund we’re setting up in my
brother’s name, which -- each year --
will sponsor a deserving Student of
Diversity or Disability of my choosing.
(then)
Lastly.
45.
(MORE)
To know this evening’s main entertainment
is to be obsessed with them. Although
they usually perform their own material,
tonight they’re covering one of my
brother’s favorite songs. I give you --
(gestures to them)
-- Josie and the Pussycats.
Cheryl cedes the stage to Josie, Melody, and Valerie. Without a
word of introduction, they start to perform an acoustic version of
Tears for Fears' “Mad World.” It's haunting, beautiful...
JOSIE AND THE PUSSYCATS
“All around me are familiar faces/Worn
out places, worn out faces...”
Kids -- couples -- drift onto the dance floor. Veronica, off to
the side, looks on, at Archie and Betty slow-dancing...
BETTY
...does working with Ms. Grundy mean no
Varsity football?
ARCHIE
(shaking his head)
I’ll study with Ms. Grundy before school,
football practice after-school, working
at my Dad’s on weekends, it’ll be nuts --
BETTY
-- so long as you don’t give up your
passion...
Veronica’s gesturing to Betty from the side-lines, “Do it.”
BETTY (CONT’D)
Uhm. Now that I’m a River Vixen and you’re
gonna be on Varsity Football, I have this
fantasy of us being a power-couple, Archie,
the Kim and Kanye of Riverdale High...
ARCHIE
Betty...
BETTY
...is that so impossible to
imagine?
Archie looks from Betty, to Ms. Grundy, chatting with Mr.
Weatherbee. As “Mad World” continues, WE FLASHBACK TO...
EXT. SWEETWATER RIVER - EARLY MORNING (FLASHBACK)
...Archie with Ms. Grundy, lying on a blanket, on one side of the
river. Intimate, forbidden...
MS. GRUNDY
We should get back to town. Before people
start waking up.
46.
CHERYL (CONT’D)
ARCHIE
It’s the Fourth, everyone’s sleeping in.
Ms. Grundy gently traces a finger along Archie’s cheek...
MS. GRUNDY
...in that case, happy fourth of July,
Archie.
ARCHIE
(he smiles)
Happy fourth of --
-- the unmistakable sound of a LOUD GUNSHOT, followed by a GIRL’S
SCREAM (Cheryl’s), echoing from across the river, interrupts them;
they sit up, their reverie shattered --
INT. RIVERDALE HIGH - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
-- while, back at the dance, Reggie smashes into Betty and Archie.
Breaking the spell. He’s drunk, belligerent --
REGGIE -- YOU made Varsity? YOU did? You don’t
even like football -- I was next in line --
It was Jason, then me --
Reggie takes a crazy SWING at Archie, who dodges it, grabs
Reggie’s arm, twists it around behind Reggie --
ARCHIE
-- what is your problem, Reg? Take it up with
Coach, but DON’T get in my face about this --
Veronica arrives, seconds from a full-blown fight erupting, just
as Cheryl joins them as well --
CHERYL
Hold that thought, Veronica, because I’ve
ordered a fleet of Ubers to take us to my
after-party --
(looking at Betty)
Attendance is mandatory for River Vixens,
I’m afraid --
(to Archie and Reggie)
And boys, let’s channel all this healthy
young male aggression into something more
productive, shall we? My parents are
away, but their liquor cabinet is open.
For. Business. There’ll be sex, booze,
and party games galore --
OFF ALL THE KIDS, no way is this going to end well tonight...
END OF ACT FOUR
47.
ACT FIVE
EXT. BLOSSOM HOME - BACKYARD - NIGHT
Weirdly, Cheryl’s AFTER-PARTY is more packed than the dance. There
are, indeed, bars with BARTENDERS, kegs, tiki torches. We find our
kids in a clump, holding red solo cups. Other PARTY-GOERS are
jumping into Cheryl’s POOL. The MUSIC’s ridiculously loud...
BETTY
(to Cheryl, yelling to be heard)
UHM. IS THERE A BATHROOM?
CHERYL
YOU CAN USE MINE. INSIDE, SECOND FLOOR.
Veronica sees this exchange, grabs --
VERONICA
-- ARCHIE! WHY DON’T YOU GO WITH BETTY?
TO MAKE SURE SHE FINDS IT WITHOUT BEING
MAULED.
ARCHIE
OKAY.
Betty mouths “Thank you” to Veronica -- which Cheryl clocks. Archie
and Betty head into the house. Cheryl smiles at Veronica in a “Isee-exactly-what-you’re-doing” kind of way...
INT. BLOSSOM HOME - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
Archie and Betty, walking down the hall. Trying to find the
bathroom. They're both tipsy, taking in the grandeur.
ARCHIE
...how rich are the Blossoms?
BETTY
They own half the town, Archie. They’re
super-rich.
-- Betty stops -- she’s opened a door to a room -- gasps --
BETTY (CONT’D)
-- oh, my, God, Archie...
ARCHIE
What?
(looks in)
Holy shit...
INT. BLOSSOM HOUSE - JASON BLOSSOM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Archie and Betty walk into--Jason's PERFECTLY PRESERVED BEDROOM.
The vibe they get is: Nothing's been changed since the accident.
48.
They look around. At all the TROPHIES Jason accumulated. At all
these PHOTOS of the Blossom Family. It's super-creepy and shrinelike...
On Jason’s desk, Betty finds a ratty copy of “Catcher in the Rye.”
Pressed in its pages, barely sticking out, there’s a STRIP of
PHOTOS, like from a photo-booth. Betty pulls it out...
It’s PHOTOS OF JASON WITH...POLLY, before her fall from grace.
She’s blonde, wholesome, wearing a cheerleading outfit, and here,
now, we understand why it means so much to Betty to be a Vixen...
She pockets the photo. Meanwhile, Archie, looking at all the
shelves...
ARCHIE
...we went to the same high school, the
same junior high, the same elementary
school, and...I don’t even know who Jason’s
friends are. Or were.
VOICE (O.S.)
My son was a private person.
They turn towards -- a tall, regal, heavily doped-up WOMAN. In a
silk robe with red-hair. Otherworldly, she’s: PENELOPE BLOSSOM.
PENELOPE BLOSSOM
I doubt he’d appreciate you being in here.
ARCHIE
Mrs. Blossom, we -- we didn’t know you were
home.
BETTY
We were looking for --
Cheryl appears at her mother’s side --
CHERYL
-- the bathroom, they must’ve gotten
lost.
(to Penelope)
Go back to bed, Mommy. And try not to wake
Daddy.
(to Betty and Archie)
That way, to the left. And then come down
to the basement, we're gonna play a game.
INT. BLOSSOM HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT
Betty and Archie arrive -- to find Cheryl, Veronica, and Reggie,
gathered in Mr. Blossom's MAN-CAVE. Eerily lit by dozens of
CANDLES. Wood-paneled, ANIMAL HEADS on the walls, hunting rifles
in a display case.
49.
CHERYL
Good. Now that we’re all where we belong,
let’s start. I assume everyone knows what
a Rainbow Party is?
REGGIE
(drunk, to Archie) -- bro. Bro, I love you, you’re my
hermano, I forgive you...
VERONICA
A) Rainbow parties are urban legends. And
B) You’re a psycho if you think that’s
happening, Cheryl. Come on, Betty, we’re
(leaving) --
CHERYL
-- oh, relax, Prude. If I wanted to host
a Rainbow Party, I would’ve invited a
different crowd.
(takes out her iPhone)
We’re going old-school tonight. Seven
Minutes in Heaven.
VERONICA
I don’t see any bottles.
As Cheryl sets a small table in the middle of the room --
CHERYL
-- not that old-school. I have an app
that pairs paramours up, then times their
trysts in the Closet of Love. The big
question is: Who wants to go first? My
vote is “A” for Archie. Anyone care to
second it?
ARCHIE
Uh, actually --
REGGIE
(raising his hand)
Yes -- Andrews -- YES --
CHERYL (CONT’D)
All right, gather round, Kids, let's see
who's riding the Ginger Stallion tonight.
Cheryl sets her iPhone down on the table, surrounded by the kids.
A VIRTUAL ROULETTE WHEEL on the phone’s screen spins...slows
down...stops on Betty -- Cheryl gently bumps the table -- the
wheel makes one more revolution, finally lands on...Veronica.
CHERYL (CONT’D)
The new girl. This should be fun.
ARCHIE
Hang on --
REGGIE
Yes -- Stud -- Bulldogs --
50.
VERONICA
I’m not doing this.
CHERYL
That’s up to you. But if you don’t, House
Rules decree the Host gets to take your
turn.
(then)
You know, you don't have to do anything Xrated in the closet, you can just -- ask
each other deep, probing questions.
(turns to:)
-- you wouldn't object to that, Betty,
would you? Especially not if I told you
tonight’s only the first part of your
initiation as a River Vixen?
(off her look)
Oh, sweet, sweet Betty, did you really
think there wouldn’t be a price to pay?
(Betty’s silent)
I mean, it’s not like you’re crushing on
Archie -- or, wait, are you? And I had no
idea?
(back to Archie/Veronica)
Seven minutes. Two Taylor Swift songs.
Betty looks stricken as Archie and Veronica head towards...
INT. BLOSSOM HOUSE - BASEMENT CLOSET - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)
DARKNESS. Then -- one iPhone lights up. Then -- a second iPhone
lights up. Archie and Veronica, lit only by their cell phones,
huddle in the dark...
VERONICA
I know her brother died and everything,
but Cheryl Blossom truly is the AntiChrist -- how much time do we have left?
ARCHIE
(checking)
Six minutes, forty seconds...
(then)
Do you miss New York?
VERONICA
It’s been less than a week. But yes.
ARCHIE
Six minutes, twenty seconds. Now you go.
Ask me a deep, probing question. To, uhm.
Kill time.
VERONICA
It looked like you and Betty were having
fun at the dance.
51.
ARCHIE
Definitely. We’ve been friends forever.
My turn.
VERONICA
I didn’t ask my question yet. Is that all
it is? Just friends?
ARCHIE
Not just friends, best friends. My turn:
Did you have a boyfriend back in New York?
VERONICA
No. My turn: Could it ever possibly
become something more?
ARCHIE
Are you asking for Betty or for yourself?
Five minutes, forty-five seconds...
VERONICA
For Betty -- and you didn’t answer my
question.
ARCHIE
I, uh. Know what you’re trying to do -- get
us together -- but it’s not gonna happen...
I’ve never felt -- whatever that thing I’m
supposed to feel is -- with Betty.
VERONICA
Have you felt it, though? With anyone?
ARCHIE
-- yes -- this summer -- have you?
VERONICA
No -- maybe once.
(then, realizing)
You’re a little more dangerous than you
look, aren’t you? All Boy-Next-Door-ish?
ARCHIE
You have no idea... Or, maybe...you do.
VERONICA
Your turn. Ask me a question, Archie...
(putting it out there)
Ask me anything you want...
The air -- the space -- between them is THICK with sexual tension.
So Archie and Veronica start to kiss... Tentatively at first, then
more and more passionately...
END OF ACT FIVE
52.
ACT SIX
INT. BLOSSOM HOME - BASEMENT - NIGHT (6.5 MINUTES LATER)
Sheepishly, Archie and Veronica emerge from the closet...
CHERYL
You lasted the full seven minutes, color
me impressed.
VERONICA
Where’s Betty, you shady bitch?
CHERYL
(smiling wickedly)
She left. Strangely, she seemed upset.
Archie and Veronica trade a look. They both take out their cell
phones, start to call her --
CHERYL (CONT’D)
I’ve tried. I think her phone’s off, it
keeps going straight to voice-mail.
Reggie, lying on the couch, drunk, moans...
CHERYL (CONT’D)
Meanwhile, who’s driving that hot mess
home?
ARCHIE
(to Veronica)
We should probably try to find --
VERONICA
-- Archie can. I’ll take an Uber.
(to Archie)
Believe me, the last thing Betty wants is
us tracking her down, together.
From the look on Veronica’s face, we can tell: She's already
regretting those seven minutes...
PRE-LAP: The sound of quiet KNOCKING...
INT. COOPER HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Betty, outside Polly’s room, at the BLACK DOOR, knocking...
BETTY
...Polly? Are you in there...? I, I’m
sorry about that stupid fight...
(on the verge of tears)
 ...it’s just -- so hard sometimes, you
know? With mom and, and everything...
53.
We remember, in this moment, that Betty’s actually only sixteenyears-old...
BETTY (CONT’D)
...please, Polly, if you’re in there, talk
to me, let me in...
INT. COOPER HOUSE - POLLY’S ROOM - SAME-TIME
Polly, standing just inside her room, against the door, listening,
but not answering Betty...
VERONICA (PRE-LAP)
Hey, Daddy, it’s me...
INT./EXT. UBER CAR - STREETS OF RIVERDALE - NIGHT
Veronica, in the backseat of a Prius, leaving a similar message:
VERONICA
...you won’t get this till the weekend, but
I didn’t want you worrying -- Mom’s fine,
I’m fine, we -- we hope you’re holding up,
and...
As with Betty, we see how young and vulnerable Veronica is here.
How alike they are, in a way. She’s fighting tears...
VERONICA (CONT’D)
...and I wanted to tell you...I’m trying, Daddy, I’m trying so hard...
EXT. POP'S CHOCK’LIT SHOPPE DINER - NIGHT
Walking home from dropping-off Reggie, reeling from the night,
Archie passes the one place in town that's open. POP’S diner. He
sees someone in a booth --Jughead -- waves to him, goes in...
INT. POP'S DINER - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
...joins his former-friend, JUGHEAD, who sits in front of his open
laptop and a cold, half-drunk cup of coffee. Archie lifts his
hand. Signs H-E-Y. Jughead signs back. H-E-Y. Then, Jughead turns
on a HEARING-AID he wears in his right ear, beneath his weird hat.
NOTE: When Jughead talks in this scene, it’s with the same voice
as in our V-O, but the cadence is different, slower. It’s the
voice of someone who’s forgotten what he sounds like.
ARCHIE
Can I sit?
(Jughead shrugs; Archie does)
What are you working on?
54.
JUGHEAD
Novel.
ARCHIE
Cool. Still?
JUGHEAD
Takes awhile. Had a break-through this
summer. Finally landed on something to
write about...
(then)
Coach Kleats was in here. Varsity? That
makes you, what, Mr. Popular Football God
now?
ARCHIE
Uh, no, not so sure about that... In
fact, I’m kind of terrified I lost my
best friend tonight...
JUGHEAD
Yeah, you do that a lot.
(then)
If you mean Betty, whatever happened,
just talk to her, man. That would go a
long way.
(then)
Would’ve gone a long way with me.
ARCHIE
I was actually thinking...
(putting it out there)
...I would maybe write her a song...to
explain, exactly, how much she means to
me...
Jughead’s silent. Doesn’t give a shit about Archie’s music story.
Archie looks out the window. The town, in darkness. Then:
ARCHIE (CONT’D)
...did you know Jason Blossom, Jug?
(he shakes his head “no”)
Seventeen years old...and how will he be
remembered? As Captain of the Water Polo
Team? The Aquaholics?
JUGHEAD
Considering how he died, probably not.
ARCHIE
What I mean is, did he make this place --
this shitty town -- better?
JUGHEAD
The Jason Blossoms of the world rarely do.
55.
ARCHIE
-- Juggie, I’m sorry, man. I never said
that to you, but -- I’m so fucking sorry.
JUGHEAD
For which part of it?
ARCHIE
All of it -- everything. I was a real
dick.
JUGHEAD
Yeah, you were.
(then)
...what do you want me to say? What do
you even want, Archie?
ARCHIE
...I...don’t want to die without us being
friends again.
Jughead considers this.
JUGHEAD
...I don’t even know you, Archie. You
might as well be Jason Blossom to me.
Jughead takes a sip of coffee, that’s all he’s saying tonight...
(Yep, we’ll be picking this story up in Episode Two...)
INT. THE LODGE APARTMENT - NIGHT
Veronica comes home from Cheryl’s, to find Hermione, having a
glass of wine.
HERMIONE
I was about to take my Ambien. How was
the dance?
VERONICA
(covering)
It was okay. I mean, it wasn’t -- the Met
Ball or anything...
Hermione pats the cushion next to her; Veronica sits.
HERMIONE
Our first week and we survived. And
you’re making friends.
VERONICA
...I, I’m super-tired, Mom.
HERMIONE
Okay, okay...
56.
Hermione stands -- starts to go -- stops.
HERMIONE (CONT’D)
I had a nice night tonight. I reconnected
with Betty’s mom, Alice, and I -- I think
they’re going to be real allies to us,
Veronica. Both of them. That’s good news,
isn’t it?
Veronica stares ahead, doesn't know what to say...
ALICE (PRE-LAP)
She knew. Hermione knew what her husband
was doing.
INT. THE COOPER HOUSE - ALICE AND HAL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Alice and her husband Hal, getting ready for bed. Undressing.
HAL
She said that?
ALICE
Of course not, she lied. The way she did
in high school. Like when she tried to
steal you away from me.
HAL
Oh, come on, Alice. Hermione was a flirt,
she -- she flirted with everyone.
ALICE
(uh-huh)
She and her daughter are a story, Hal,
the story that's going to change
everything for us, for “The Register.”
Everything the Blossom story wasn’t.
HAL
Be careful, Alice, you’re spinning into
butter. The Lodges are still a powerful
family.
Alice fixes her husband with a warning stare. Daggers there.
ALICE
You be careful, Hal. I don't want history
repeating itself. Hermione broke your
heart once, she’ll do it again.
EXT. THE ANDREWS HOUSE - NIGHT
This late, Archie's exhausted, but wired. As he starts up the walk
to his house, Betty steps out from the shadows. She'd been waiting
for him, on his porch.
57.
BETTY
...I'm not going to ask what you did with
Veronica at Cheryl's -- that was just a
stupid party game -- but I’m asking you
now, right now, if you love me, Archie?
ARCHIE
Betty --
BETTY
-- or, even like me? Just -- please tell
me. Respect me, respect our friendship,
enough to be honest with me.
ARCHIE
I...
BETTY
Or do I need to say it for you?
ARCHIE
...I...I'm so sorry, Betty, of course I
love you, but...I can't give you the
answer you want...
Betty’s eyes are wet with tears, but she’s pushing through.
BETTY
...why -- why can’t you?
ARCHIE ...so many reasons...but the main one is...
(shaking his head)
...you’re so perfect, Betty, I’d never be
good enough for you... I’ve never been
good enough for you...
The two life-long friends look at each other -- hearts breaking --
a truth between them finally spoken aloud...
EXT. SWEETWATER RIVER - NIGHT
Post-dance, Kevin and British hottie Devin have come here for an
illicit tryst. They’re on the river’s edge, wrestling to take each
other’s shirts and pants off --
DEVIN
What do you like to do?
KEVIN
I’m versatile, but can we -- could we
maybe just start with skinny-dipping?
Devin stops. Looks at Kevin. It’s actually kind of sweet...
DEVIN
Yeah, sure, that’s brilliant.
58.
Kevin and Devin head towards the water, stripping their clothes
off, when -- all of a sudden -- Devin trips over a DARK MASS on
the river’s bank.
DEVIN
Bloody hell --
KEVIN
You okay?
They kneel down next to it, use their iPhones as flashlights to
reveal: JASON BLOSSOM'S water-logged, rotten corpse, tangled in
river weeds, half his face eaten by fish. A bullet hole in his
forehead...
KEVIN
Oh, shit...
INT. POP'S DINER - NIGHT
Jughead, typing away at his keyboard, resuming with his V-O:
JUGHEAD (V.O.)
...by morning, everyone would be talking,
texting, and posting about it... We’d all
be feeling it. That the world around us
had changed, forever...
EXT. SWEETWATER RIVER - EARLY MORNING
The ENTIRE TOWN, all our characters, have gathered. As Riverdale
Police, led again by DETECTIVE SAM HILL, help PARAMEDICS load
Jason’s BODY into an AMBULANCE... Betty’s there, with Polly and
her folks. Veronica, Hermione. Archie’s with his parents. Ms.
Grundy’s there with Weatherbee, other teachers and students...
They all look...transformed. Scared. Especially Cheryl, who’s
climbing into the ambulance, bizarrely, without her parents...
JUGHEAD (V.O.)
...that Riverdale wasn't the same town
anymore. That if we'd ever been innocent,
we weren't anymore...
(then)
On Monday, the autopsy would take place.
And on Tuesday, halfway through fifthperiod, the first arrest would be made,
shaking the very foundation of Riverdale
High.
SMASH TO BLACK -- END OF PILOT.
59.
